# WinAPI C++ Physics project

This is a C++ program, using the WinAPI to draw a dialog frame.
The frame allows the user to choose whether the resistors are inline or parallel, which then takes in the number of resistors and moves to the console to get input regarding the resistance values for each resistor.
The program then outputs in the console the total resistance value for the circuit, given the above parameters.
